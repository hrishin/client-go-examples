# Kubernetes Client-Go Examples
This repository contains some useful and ready to use examples of the [`Kubernetes client go`](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go).

_Go clients for talking to a kubernetes cluster_

## Motivation
Often a time we need to discover some 
common examples and sometime its hard to find the API usage document.
In order to address this pain, this repository will try to hold commonly used client go API's examples.

## Examples
