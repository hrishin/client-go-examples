# Kubernetes Client-Go Examples:
This repository contains some useful and ready to use examples of the [`Kubernetes client go`](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go).

_Go clients for talking to a kubernetes cluster_

## Motivation:
Often a time I see users in the Kubernetes community or myself need to discover some 
common examples. Sometime its hard to find API usage.
In order to address it, this repository will try to hold commonly used client go API's examples.

## Examples:
 - [Delete the `Statefulset` without depeling it dependent resources such as pods](examples/statefulsets-no-cascade)
